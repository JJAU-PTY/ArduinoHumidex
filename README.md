# ArduinoHumidex
The ArduinoHumidex is a project where the arduino reads the temperature, pressure and humidity of the air; while it calculates the Humidex and dewpoint values. This data is sent to Thingspeak.

The sensors used are the SparkFun BMP180 and a DHT11. The Arduino connects to internet using the Ethernet Shield.
